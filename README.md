Cancer is one of the most unresolved problems in the world, indeed, a statistic done in 2020 stated that one in 5 people on average will develop cancer in
their lifetime.

In particular, brain cancer is one of the most deadly, with a very low survival rate for both sexes, which is why it is widely studied and investigated in the scientific field in different
areas. 

Particularly, profiling the molecular features associated with the morphological landscape of tissues is critical for investigating the structural and spatial patterns that underlie the biological function of tissues.
Fortunately, however, in recent years, several methods for multiplexed tissue imaging have been implemented, image processing can gave use information about statistics and predictions in a completely non intrusive manner.

In this project, I have tried to use state-of-the-art methods to predict and do analysis and statistics on an image of glioma cells, more information can be found in the note book and the report.
